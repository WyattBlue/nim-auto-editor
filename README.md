## Nim-Auto-Editor Archive

This is an archive of the old Nim Auto-Editor while the python version was used. See: https://github.com/WyattBlue/auto-editor for the most up to update program.

## Building
You will need [the Nim compiler](https://nim-lang.org/), a Unix environment.

```
nimble makeff
nimble make
```

To install, just move the binary to a $PATH directory.
